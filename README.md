# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning

## Overview
This project is designed to predict customer churn using deep learning techniques. By analyzing key customer attributes such as demographic, financial, and account-related data, a deep neural network model provides accurate predictions on the likelihood of a customer leaving. The web application is built with Streamlit, offering an interactive interface where users can input customer details and receive instant predictions.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: A neural network model trained to predict churn based on customer data.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Users can enter customer details and get instant churn probability predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes scaling of numerical data and encoding of categorical features such as gender and geography.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use form to input customer information.
- **Churn Probability**: Displays the probability of churn and categorizes it as high or low risk.

## Requirements
To run this project, youâ€™ll need the following Python libraries:
- `streamlit`
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pickle`

## Files in the Repository
- `app.py`: The main Streamlit app that runs the interface and prediction logic.
- `model.h5`: The pre-trained deep learning model saved in H5 format.
- `label_encoder_gender.pkl`: Label encoder for the gender feature.
- `onehot_encoder_geo.pkl`: One-hot encoder for the geography feature.
- `scaler.pkl`: Standard scaler used to scale numerical data.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.


## How It Works
1. **Data Input**: The user is prompted to input customer details such as geography, gender, age, balance, credit score, salary, tenure, and other relevant features.
2. **Preprocessing**: The input data is processed using the pre-loaded encoders and scaler. Categorical features are encoded, and numerical data is scaled.
3. **Prediction**: The preprocessed data is passed through the deep learning model to predict the likelihood of churn.
4. **Result**: A probability value is displayed, indicating the likelihood of the customer churning, along with a visual indication (green for low risk, red for high risk).

## Example
**Input**:
- Geography: France
- Gender: Female
- Age: 45
- Balance: 12000
- Credit Score: 650
- Estimated Salary: 55000
- Tenure: 24 months
- Number of Products: 3
- Has Credit Card: Yes
- Is Active Member: Yes

**Output**:
- Churn Probability: 95.%36
- The customer is **not likely** to churn.
